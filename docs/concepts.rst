Core concepts
=============

Data model
----------

Terracotta is agnostic to the organization of your data, but you can
cast almost any hierarchy into an API structure. The Terracotta data
model is heavily inspired by the way we found ourselves organizing
raster files on a hard drive:

.. image:: _figures/raster_folder.png
   :scale: 70%

In this case, the raster images are fully categorized by their path,
following the pattern

.. code-block:: none

   {type}/{sensor}_denmark_{date}_{...}_{band}.tif

The placeholders in curly brackets is what we call *keys*. You can see
that this pattern of keys covers all raster files:

   ``reflectances/S2_denmark_20180524_B03.tif``

      has type ``reflectances``, sensor ``S2``, date ``20180524``,
      and band ``B03``

   ``radar/S1_denmark_20180615_A_073_VV.tif``

      has type ``radar``, sensor ``S1``, date ``20180615``,
      and band ``VV``

   ``indices/S2_denmark_20180506_ndvi.tif``

      has type ``indices``, sensor ``S2``, date ``20180506``,
      and band ``ndvi`` (even though NDVI is not really a spectral
      band, it does fit the scheme well - sometimes organizing your
      data is about making compromises).

Keys can have any names and (string) values, and they do have a fixed
order. Keys are matched by alphanumeric values, and other characters
(``-``, ``_`` or anything other than a letter or number) are treated as
value separators.

In Terracotta, the keys identifying a dataset immediately lead
to an API representation. You can start a server for the example above
via :doc:`terracotta serve <cli-commands/serve>`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ terracotta serve -r {type}/{sensor}_denmark_{date}_{}_{band}.tif

Then, the URL

.. code-block:: none

   localhost:5000/rgb/reflectances/20180524/preview.png?r=B04&g=B03&b=B02

gives you an RGB image composed of the raster files
``reflectances/S2_denmark_20180524_{B04,B03,B02}.tif``, and

.. code-block:: none

   localhost:5000/singleband/indices/20180506/ndvi/{z}/{x}/{y}.png

serves the file ``indices/S2_denmark_20180506_ndvi.tif`` as an XYZ tile
layer. You can also search for data; the query

.. code-block:: none

   localhost:5000/datasets?type=indices&band=ndvi

returns a JSON array of all known NDVI datasets.

.. note::

   While keys in Terracotta are certainly inspired by file naming
   conventions, they do not need to coincide with actual file names. You
   are free to ingest a file called ``myraster.tif`` with the keys
   ``('S2', '20180601', 'B04')`` should you wish to do so.


Architecture
------------

.. image:: _figures/architecture-660px.png

In Terracotta, all heavy lifting is done by a so-called **driver**. The
driver specifies where and how Terracotta can find the raster data and
metadata it requires to serve a dataset. Most drivers use a database to
store metadata and rely on a file system to store raster data, but
neither of those assumptions are enforced by the API.

Currently implemented drivers include:

   **SQLite + GeoTiff**

      Metadata is backed in an SQLite database, along
      with the paths to the (physical) raster files. This is the simplest
      driver, and is used by default in most applications. Both the SQLite
      database and the raster files may be stored in AWS S3 buckets.

   **MySQL + GeoTiff**

      Similar to the SQLite driver, but uses a
      centralized MySQL database to store metadata. This driver is an
      excellent candidate for deployments on cloud services, e.g. through
      `AWS Aurora Serverless <https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/>`__.

   **PostgreSQL + GeoTiff**

      Similar to the SQLite driver, but uses a
      centralized PostgreSQL database to store metadata. This driver is also an
      excellent candidate for deployments on cloud services, e.g. through
      `AWS Aurora Serverless <https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/>`__.


Why serverless?
---------------

We think that serverless architectures (specifically AWS Lambda) are a great
fit for tile servers:

- Many tile servers host highly specialized data that is only used
  sporadically. However, even a single user fires hundreds of concurrent
  requests. AWS Lambda makes it possible to keep costs low when things are slow
  while providing the capacity needed for peak times.
- Concurrency is key to a good user experience, and much more important
  than single-tile loading times.
- Serverless deployments are virtually maintenance-free and can stay
  online for years.


Limitations
-----------

Terracotta is light-weight and optimized for simplicity and flexibility.
This has a few trade-offs:

-  The number of keys and their names are fixed for one Terracotta
   instance. You have to organize all of your data into the same
   structure - or deploy several instances of Terracotta.
-  Terracotta keys are always strings and carry no intrinsic meaning.
   You can search and filter available datasets through exact
   comparisons (e.g. by calling ``/datasets?type=index&date=20180101``),
   but more sophisticated operations have to take place in the frontend.
-  You can only use the last key to compose RGB images (i.e., the last
   key must be ``band`` or similar).
-  Since the names and semantics of the keys of a Terracotta deployment
   are flexible, there are no guarantees that two different Terracotta
   deployments have the same dataset API. However, all information is
   transparently available from the frontend, via the ``/swagger.json``,
   ``/apidoc``, and ``/keys`` API endpoints.
-  While Terracotta is pretty fast, we favor flexibility over raw speed.
   If sub-second response times are a hard requirement for you,
   Terracotta might not be the right tool for the job.
